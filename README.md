# Snake-Vision
This project focuses on key techniques in computer vision, specifically edge detection, shape detection, and object segmentation. Developed by Team 18, we explore and implement fundamental algorithms such as the Canny edge detector, Hough Transform for detecting lines, circles, and ellipses, and Active Contours for contour detection. These methods are essential in various applications, from image analysis to autonomous systems.

Our aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of these techniques, showcasing their capabilities through visual examples and practical implementations. This repository serves as a resource for those interested in computer vision and image processing, offering both theoretical insights and practical code samples.

## Project Features
- Canny Edge Detection: Implements a multi-stage process including Gaussian smoothing, gradient calculation, non-maximum suppression, and hysteresis thresholding.
- Hough Transform: Detects geometric shapes (lines, circles, ellipses) in images.
- Hough Lines: Identifies straight lines using the Hough line transform with Canny edge detector.
- Hough Circles: Detects circles by collecting votes in a 2D accumulator.
- Hough Ellipses: Fits ellipses to detected contours by adapting methods from recent research.
- Active Contours: Performs object segmentation and boundary extraction using energy minimization techniques.
